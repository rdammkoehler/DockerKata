# List Images

Docker Documentation References:

[docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/)

## Intent

The purpose of this kata is to familarize yourself with the process of listing existing images in your local docker configuration.

## Overview

In this exercise we will list the images on our local machine. We should see one image from the [previous exercise](01_pull_and_run_image.md). Later we will delete this image.

## Kata Steps

### List Images

**Command**

```bash
docker images
```

**Output**

```bash
thought:DockerKata rich$ docker images
